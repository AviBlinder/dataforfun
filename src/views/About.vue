                        <h1>A brief introduction</h1>
                        <p>
                          There is a line among the fragments of the Greek poet
                          Archilochus which says: ‘The fox knows many things,
                          but the hedgehog knows one big thing’.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Although both ways have pros and cons, I find myself
                          more and more on the fox side.<br />
                          So, this site is all about sharing my experience and
                          knowledge in a myriad of fields, which range from
                          Digital Marketing, Data Science, Big Data, and many
                          other fields of my interest.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          I hope we enjoy the journey<br />
                          .
